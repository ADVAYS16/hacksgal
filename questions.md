<h1>Customization 1</h1>

<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>

<p>Effective wireframes should prioritize user needs and be brief, indicating the intended interactivity and being achievable to implement in code. When constructing a wireframe, it's crucial to consider that the user experience should flow logically, without distracting from the content, in addition to being visually appealing.<p>


<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>

<p>User testing is an integral part of designing user interfaces and wireframes in computer science. By conducting user testing, designers can gather feedback from real users and evaluate how well their design aligns with user needs and preferences. This information can then be used to refine and improve the design, resulting in a better user experience.<p>

<h1>Customization 2</h1>

<h2>1. What is Bootstrap and how is it useful n developing websites?</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is a CSS library that provides modular styling classes for developers to use instead of creating their own from scratch.<p>
<h2>2. What are the benefits of using Bootstrap in web development compared to css?</h2>
<p>Bootstrap is CSS. I'm assuming you're referring to the practice of rolling your own CSS. By leveraging Bootstrap classes, the developer can save valuable time and instead use it for actual content development.
<p>
<h2>3. How can you include Bootstrap in YOUR website development?</h2>
<p>You can the resource to your HTML `<head>` tag and simply mark HTML elements with whatever classes you would like.<p>
<h2>4. What do selectors do? Explain one selector in your own words.</h2>
<p>Selectors allow you to refer to a singular element or a collection of HTML elements by an identifying attribute. Often, selectors select on the basis of the `class` attribute. The `.test` selector, for example, would apply styling to all elements with the `test` class.<p>

<h1>JavaScript</h1>

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>
<p>The code segment employs "if" statements to check if the snake has gone beyond the canvas's boundary in the x direction (Line 60). Additionally, the "forEach" higher-order method is used for iteration to traverse through each cell of the snake and draw the corresponding image on the canvas (Line 85).<p>
<!--<p>ANSWER</p>-->
<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>
<p>The `:root` selector allows you to define CSS variables for use throughout the rest of the program.<p>
<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>
<p>HTML is used for laying out the elements of a site, CSS arranges and styles these elements, and JavaScript adds interactivity to these elements. Each of these 3 languages has different syntaxâ€”HTML is a markup language, CSS is a styling-based markup language, and JavaScript is more of a traditional, imperative/object-oriented language.<p>
